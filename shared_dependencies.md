Shared Dependencies:

1. **AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, StoppingCriteria, StoppingCriteriaList**: These are the classes from the transformers library that are used across the application for language model, tokenization, and stopping criteria.

2. **torch**: This is the library used for tensor computations and is used across the application.

3. **StopOnTokens**: This is a custom class that is used as a stopping criteria for the language model. It is used in the models.py and api.py files.

4. **SimpleChatBotUI**: This is the main class that encapsulates the chatbot functionality. It is used in the main.py file to run the application and in the api.py file to handle API requests.

5. **model_name**: This is a variable that holds the name of the model to be used. It is used in the settings.py file to allow the user to change the model, and in the models.py and api.py files to load the model.

6. **system_prompt**: This is a variable that holds the system prompt for the chatbot. It is used in the models.py and api.py files to generate responses.

7. **generate_response**: This is a method in the SimpleChatBotUI class that generates a response from the chatbot. It is used in the api.py file to handle API requests and in the gui.py file to display responses in the GUI.

8. **run**: This is a method in the SimpleChatBotUI class that runs the chatbot. It is used in the main.py file to start the application.

9. **DOM Elements**: The index.html file will have DOM elements like buttons and text areas that will be used by the main.js file to handle user interactions. The id names of these elements will be shared between the index.html and main.js files.

10. **main.css**: This file will contain the styles for the DOM elements in the index.html file. The class and id names of these elements will be shared between the index.html and main.css files.
